📊 Data Professionals Dashboard – Power BI Capstone


📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built from a global survey of 561 data professionals.
It explores salary trends, job satisfaction, education levels, industries, and tool usage across diverse regions.

The goal was to clean, transform, and visualize data in a way that helps stakeholders — from recruiters to career coaches — gain actionable insights.


🔑 Key Insights

💰 Data Scientists earn the highest salaries, followed by Data Engineers.

🏢 Surprisingly, Education & Healthcare sectors recorded higher average salaries than Tech & Finance.

🎓 Higher education = higher income: PhD and Master’s holders consistently earn more.

🙂 Only 39% reported high job satisfaction, showing a gap between expectations and reality.

🛠 Most commonly used tools: Excel & Power BI (DAX) — still essential in the analytics space.



🛠 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Removed incomplete salary records and missing roles.

Grouped job roles and education levels into broader categories.

Added calculated columns: Experience Bands, Salary Brackets, Satisfaction Categories.

Converted all salaries to USD and removed extreme outliers.

Designed filters & slicers for interactive exploration (Country, Industry, Tools, Salary).



🎯 Stakeholder Relevance

Recruiters → Benchmark compensation trends across industries and roles.

HR Leaders → Identify dissatisfaction drivers and design retention strategies.

Career Coaches → Guide students/new entrants toward in-demand roles like Data Science.

Educators/Policy Makers → Shape curricula & reskilling aligned with market demand.
